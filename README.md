# NETPICKS

### View the live project [here.](https://daniellee86.github.io/react_movieDiscoverReviewApp/)

This project began life as a pair programming exercise with [Pip Allen](https://github.com/pippa789). The aim for the session was to work with the animation library: framer-motion. To do this we made use of The Movie Database API and filtered movie categories for dynamic rendering. Since then I have continued to add multiple pages and more features to this app including; Homepage, featured movie component, description modals, and a live search feature.
